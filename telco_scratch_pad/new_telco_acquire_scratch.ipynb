The answer is 'No' because one, they make up too large a percentage of the overall data (nearly 22%) to just drop without any affect on model performance.  Second, upon closer investigation, the phrase 'No internet service' seems to be another way of stating the 'internet_service_type_id' of '3,' which does, in fact, have an influence in who / why people churn."
